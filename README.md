# Titanic Survival Prediction - Gradient Boosting Case Study 🚢🌲

This project applies **Gradient Boosting Classification** to the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `titanic.csv` – Dataset
- `Gradient Boosting Case Study.ipynb` – Analysis and model building notebook

## 🔍 Objective

Use machine learning to predict whether a passenger survived based on features such as class, age, fare, and embarked location.

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📊 Techniques Used

- Data preprocessing
- Dummy variable creation
- Feature scaling
- Gradient Boosting with hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation with:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report
  - ROC Curve & AUC

## 🚀 Results

- Best model achieved **91.3% validation accuracy** with learning rate `0.5`.
- ROC Curve and AUC confirmed strong classification performance.
